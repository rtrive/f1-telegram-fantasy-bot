# As described here (https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Making-your-bot-persistent),
# Job's and the job_queue is not supported. However, the current JobQueue backend APScheduler has its own persistence
# logic that you can leverage.
# We have been redirected here (https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/ptbcontrib/tree/main/ptbcontrib/ptb_sqlalchemy_jobstore)
# and the next liens of code come from there.
